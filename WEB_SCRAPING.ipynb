They are getting real results with agentic automation. The most forward-thinking enterprises are orchestrating AI agents, deterministic robots, and people into impactful, end-to-end workflows. At our recent Agentic AI Summit, we showcased how UiPath customers are building autonomous enterprise agents to drive transformational value and change the way we work. One of the best examples came from Emily Krohne, Enterprise Automation Principal at WEX, the global payments company. After leading a three-year transformation with UiPath, Emily is driving an agentic automation program to enhance sales team preparation and streamline document processing. Check out my full interview as part of the Agentic AI Summit Keynote here . In this recap, I’ll share the most compelling stories and announcements from the UiPath Agentic AI Summit: UiPath Agent Builder: how to build, test, and deploy specialized enterprise agents Enterprises want to use AI agents but need to ensure accurate, consistent, and trustworthy results. Yet, they lack the tools to build, test, and deploy these agents alongside robots and people. Organizations seek to create AI agents and orchestrate their activity in complex workflows—with robots for routine, deterministic tasks and people for critical decisions. They also require ways to customize, inspect, and refine agent behavior to increase their accuracy over time. At the Summit, we showed how UiPath helps customers develop specialized enterprise agents. UiPath Senior Product Manager Zach Eslami announced the April 30 global launch of UiPath Agent Builder . Agent Builder is a unified tool for building, testing, and deploying AI agents. It supports both pro-code and low-code users, offering simple natural language agent creation, prebuilt templates, memory and business context, as well as evaluation tools. Agent Builder creates specialized AI agents that work seamlessly across systems and ecosystems in governed, orchestrated workflows. Let’s see Agent Builder in action! Imagine you’re a financial services provider seeking to build an AI agent for your loan origination and approval process. Agent Builder allows you to create the agent by selecting a model, providing instructions in the form of prompts, and giving the agent a set of useful tools. It also makes it easy to give your agents relevant business context and add escalation paths to ensure your team is kept in the loop. At a recent agentic hackathon, WEX developers used Agent Builder, UiPath Autopilot™, and our agentic orchestration capabilities to address several business challenges. In code management, WEX built a new agent, GitHub Manager, which is estimated to save 6,000 work hours annually. For claims processing, a claims review agent now cuts review time from hours to mere seconds. Lastly, a multi-agent fraud detection system helps WEX streamline investigations, making their fraud prevention process more proactive and adaptable.  Sign up for the UiPath Insider Program to be the first to try Agent Builder. Agentic orchestration: enabling multi-agent collaboration with robots and people Businesses are increasingly adopting AI and automation tools, including AI agents, to optimize processes. However, the growing complexity of business operations—driven by a mix of siloed capabilities licensed from multiple vendors—creates challenges in process management, security, and governance. Agentic orchestration addresses this by seamlessly integrating agentic, robotic, and human-centric workflows with the systems and applications necessary for process execution. It transforms disconnected automated tasks into cohesive, end-to-end processes, enabling businesses to scale AI effectively while maintaining visibility and control. The UiPath Platform™ is an agentic orchestration leader; at the Summit, our Vice President of Product Management Arun Mehta demonstrated this with the reveal of UiPath Maestro . Now in public preview, Maestro empowers customers to orchestrate work with an ecosystem-agnostic approach. That means that, irrespective of which platform the agents or automations were built on, or which AI models they are using, every business can now model, operate, and optimize its processes with a well-tuned symphony involving multiple agents and robots—as well as people always in the loop as the leaders, coordinators, and ultimate decision makers. In the example below, Maestro orchestrates an end-to-end invoice process. See how Maestro coordinates the entire workflow, seamlessly handing off work between robots, people, and a purchase order matching agent to rapidly fulfill the request: Our customers are eager to run cross-ecosystem agentic automations with Maestro. Hannes Hudd, Manager, Business Process Automation Development at Wärtsilä, a global manufacturer of marine and energy solutions, said: Agentic orchestration is where business processes and flows come together with people, automation, and AI. The products capabilities and the rapid development pace achieved by UiPath are truly impressive! The future vision for agentic orchestration is exceptionally promising, and we are excited to see its full potential realized. Hannes Hudd, Manager, Business Process Automation Development at Wärtsilä UiPath Maestro is now available for all UiPath Automation Cloud™ customers to try ahead of its April 30 release. If you are not already a customer, you can try Automation Cloud for free —with UiPath Maestro included. IXP: transform complex documents into actionable data at speed and scale Technology analyst firm IDC has reported that 90% of data generated in an enterprise is unstructured—most often locked away in complex documents ranging from patient notes to purchase orders. This valuable context is essential for AI agents to perform at the required level of autonomy, and enterprises will need to leverage advanced intelligent document processing (IDP) capabilities to unlock this data and make it actionable.   Mark Geene, UiPath SVP & General Manager of AI Products, showed how we are supporting businesses and AI agents with our best-in-class IDP solution. He announced the April release of our new product, UiPath IXP (Intelligent Xtraction and Processing) . IXP is a major leap for UiPath IDP, leveraging AI advances that enable rapid multimodal data extraction. It provides an intuitive, prompt-based experience that eliminates the need for extensive data labeling, cutting time to production. UiPath IXP extracts the information you need from all document types, empowering you to automate more of your existing processes.  Automation engineers at WEX are already using UiPath IXP to build, test, and deploy extraction models at scale. Importing our documents to train was easy, and the predictive labeling saves us a lot of time with training. We specifically leaned into this solution because of its strong capability to recognize document types with minimal effort. Timothy Corbett, Senior Automation Engineer at WEX See how UiPath IXP drives end-to-end automation in the most complex workflows. Sign up for the private preview now . Agentic testing: the software testing revolution powered by UiPath Test Cloud Software development moves fast, but manual testing slows it down. Fortunately, agentic testing has now made it faster than ever. Equipped with AI agents, software testing teams can engage in agentic testing for supercharged productivity across the testing lifecycle. Agents are automating complex testing tasks, augmenting testers to extend, simplify, and speed up their work. To accelerate this revolution, Ingo Philipp, UiPath Senior Director of Product Management, revealed UiPath Test Cloud —the next evolution of UiPath Test Suite. UiPath Test Cloud provides a complete agentic testing platform, with resilient end-to-end test automation for modern enterprise applications, production-grade architecture and governance, and an interface catering to the needs of application testers. Users can also augment their testing with powerful agents like UiPath Autopilot™ for Testers and specialized agents built with Agent Builder. With these capabilities, teams can accelerate time to value while delivering high-quality software. Leading enterprises have already achieved great value with UiPath agentic testing. Cisco has used Autopilot for Testers to halve manual testing efforts, leading to over $1 million in projected annual savings. Financial services company State Street uses UiPath to automate the end-to-end testing of their Alpha Platform, resulting in significant time savings as compared to manual testing. You can hear more about State Street’s agentic testing vision from Brandon McCormick, State Street Global Practice Area Lead for Testing, System Performance, and Global Batch Cycle: Sign up for UiPath Test Cloud to see how agentic testing can multiply your team’s productivity. Turning agentic potential into business transformation UiPath Agentic AI Summit captured some of the early successes our customers and partners achieved with agentic automation. But we’re just getting started.   The value of agentic AI won’t be achieved with isolated AI agents. Agentic automation requires orchestration, dynamic AI, robotic precision, and human expertise to drive consistent, reliable, and transformative outcomes. The UiPath Platform gives customers the enterprise tools, agentic capabilities, and controlled agency to be leaders in this new agentic and robotic era.  Watch the UiPath Agentic AI Summit on demand to see our latest agentic capabilities in action, and join our Insider Portal to be among the first to try them out!

It transforms disconnected automated tasks into cohesive, end-to-end processes, enabling businesses to scale AI effectively while maintaining visibility and control. The UiPath Platform™ is an agentic orchestration leader; at the Summit, our Vice President of Product Management Arun Mehta demonstrated this with the reveal of UiPath Maestro . Now in public preview, Maestro empowers customers to orchestrate work with an ecosystem-agnostic approach. That means that, irrespective of which platform the agents or automations were built on, or which AI models they are using, every business can now model, operate, and optimize its processes with a well-tuned symphony involving multiple agents and robots—as well as people always in the loop as the leaders, coordinators, and ultimate decision makers. In the example below, Maestro orchestrates an end-to-end invoice process. See how Maestro coordinates the entire workflow, seamlessly handing off work between robots, people, and a purchase order matching agent to rapidly fulfill the request: Our customers are eager to run cross-ecosystem agentic automations with Maestro. Hannes Hudd, Manager, Business Process Automation Development at Wärtsilä, a global manufacturer of marine and energy solutions, said: Agentic orchestration is where business processes and flows come together with people, automation, and AI. The products capabilities and the rapid development pace achieved by UiPath are truly impressive! The future vision for agentic orchestration is exceptionally promising, and we are excited to see its full potential realized. Hannes Hudd, Manager, Business Process Automation Development at Wärtsilä UiPath Maestro is now available for all UiPath Automation Cloud™ customers to try ahead of its April 30 release. If you are not already a customer, you can try Automation Cloud for free —with UiPath Maestro included. IXP: transform complex documents into actionable data at speed and scale Technology analyst firm IDC has reported that 90% of data generated in an enterprise is unstructured—most often locked away in complex documents ranging from patient notes to purchase orders. This valuable context is essential for AI agents to perform at the required level of autonomy, and enterprises will need to leverage advanced intelligent document processing (IDP) capabilities to unlock this data and make it actionable.   Mark Geene, UiPath SVP & General Manager of AI Products, showed how we are supporting businesses and AI agents with our best-in-class IDP solution. He announced the April release of our new product, UiPath IXP (Intelligent Xtraction and Processing) . IXP is a major leap for UiPath IDP, leveraging AI advances that enable rapid multimodal data extraction. It provides an intuitive, prompt-based experience that eliminates the need for extensive data labeling, cutting time to production. UiPath IXP extracts the information you need from all document types, empowering you to automate more of your existing processes.  Automation engineers at WEX are already using UiPath IXP to build, test, and deploy extraction models at scale. Importing our documents to train was easy, and the predictive labeling saves us a lot of time with training. We specifically leaned into this solution because of its strong capability to recognize document types with minimal effort.

Agentic testing: the software testing revolution powered by UiPath Test Cloud Software development moves fast, but manual testing slows it down. Fortunately, agentic testing has now made it faster than ever. Equipped with AI agents, software testing teams can engage in agentic testing for supercharged productivity across the testing lifecycle. Agents are automating complex testing tasks, augmenting testers to extend, simplify, and speed up their work. To accelerate this revolution, Ingo Philipp, UiPath Senior Director of Product Management, revealed UiPath Test Cloud —the next evolution of UiPath Test Suite. UiPath Test Cloud provides a complete agentic testing platform, with resilient end-to-end test automation for modern enterprise applications, production-grade architecture and governance, and an interface catering to the needs of application testers. Users can also augment their testing with powerful agents like UiPath Autopilot™ for Testers and specialized agents built with Agent Builder. With these capabilities, teams can accelerate time to value while delivering high-quality software. Leading enterprises have already achieved great value with UiPath agentic testing. Cisco has used Autopilot for Testers to halve manual testing efforts, leading to over $1 million in projected annual savings. Financial services company State Street uses UiPath to automate the end-to-end testing of their Alpha Platform, resulting in significant time savings as compared to manual testing. You can hear more about State Street’s agentic testing vision from Brandon McCormick, State Street Global Practice Area Lead for Testing, System Performance, and Global Batch Cycle: Sign up for UiPath Test Cloud to see how agentic testing can multiply your team’s productivity. Turning agentic potential into business transformation UiPath Agentic AI Summit captured some of the early successes our customers and partners achieved with agentic automation. But we’re just getting started.   The value of agentic AI won’t be achieved with isolated AI agents. Agentic automation requires orchestration, dynamic AI, robotic precision, and human expertise to drive consistent, reliable, and transformative outcomes. The UiPath Platform gives customers the enterprise tools, agentic capabilities, and controlled agency to be leaders in this new agentic and robotic era.  Watch the UiPath Agentic AI Summit on demand to see our latest agentic capabilities in action, and join our Insider Portal to be among the first to try them out!
